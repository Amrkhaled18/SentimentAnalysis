# 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to real-world text data using Python. The implementation is provided in the notebook `Projcet(NLP) (1).ipynb`.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Objective**: Use NLP techniques to preprocess, analyze, and model text data to perform classification (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic classification).
- 📂 **Data Source**: The project likely uses a dataset such as movie reviews, product feedback, or a text corpus loaded via CSV or built-in datasets.
- 📈 **Final Goal**: Train and evaluate machine learning models on cleaned and vectorized textual data for predictive tasks.

## 🔄 NLP Pipeline

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Removal of punctuation
   - Conversion to lowercase
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal using NLTK
   - Optional: Lemmatization or stemming

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer

3. **Model Building**
   - Algorithms used:
     - Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Logistic Regression
   - Training and test splits using `train_test_split`

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - ROC Curve and AUC (if applicable)

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis

- Bar plots of class distributions
- Word clouds for frequent terms
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Accuracy/loss trends (if neural networks are used)
